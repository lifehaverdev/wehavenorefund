##Operation wehavenorefund

#introduction
We launched and got botted too hard.

#method
By separating bot and non bot accounts, we apply the refund to a targeted group of community. They will be given price curve averaged market value at close of trading. The method of separating bot from person is calculated by outside firm. Their calculation methods and results are located in the SibelTeamCalculations folder.

The refund will be accomplished using GASLITE airdrop and sending the market value in WETH to holders according to their amount of NO tokens. Tests and scripts are for estimation of gas costs as well as triple checking the data. 

A test refund airdrop will be ran on the goerli eth chain to quadruple check that the amounts and addresses are being served appropriately in the process.

Makefile will remain private to protect the imported wallet cryptographic key password but an example makefile with a removed password will be provided. This will represent the exact action taken on account of the nodeployer.eth address, which will perform the operations. (actually we just used drop.gaslite.org and it worked perfectly and easily with lots of helpful indications that everything was correct throughout the project we recommend that if you have to ever airdrop. He doesn't even take a cut and it saved us gas <3)
