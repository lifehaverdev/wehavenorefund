##Operation wehavenorefund

#introduction
We launched and got botted too hard.

#method
We must calculate in flows of ETH and deliniate bots and not bots using foundry scripts deliniated by transactions before the announcement. Then decide a refund strategy and prepare to use GASLITEAIRDROP with weth.

deploytoclosenohandletxs.csv is all transactions interacting with nohandle contract from block 19235497 to block 19235846 (deploy to market close) exported from etherscan. deploytoclosepoolerc20.csv is all the erc20 transfers performed on the pool. nohandleholders is all the holders as of 12:36PM CST February 16 2024.

#arthurt proposal for path forward: (pending calculation of where we stand)

calculate refund of not-bot money to holders based off of entry price and assumption that bot money is all sell pressure. Reliquify pool with bot money and resume trading. 

am i crazy?
